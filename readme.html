  <h3>Welcome to the Prestige Theme for WordPress! </h3>
  <p>Prestige marks a new phase in my theme development for WordPress users and for the future with WordPress 3. Over time, theme design will get even more advanced as I continue to add more and more themes to my WordPress themes portfolio.</p>
  <p>The Prestige theme for WordPress is an example of what is yet to come plus more. Over the span of this year, each new theme will have more features built in as I fine-tune a standard framework for my WordPress themes and templates. </p>
  <h3>Prestige  Features </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Expandable content column when the &ldquo;right&rdquo; sidebar is not being    used; Offers full width and a Right Sidebar layout</li>
      <li>HTML Snippets to give you nested 2, 3, and 4 column layouts</li>
      <li>Menu system based on your own ordering of pages</li>
      <li>Collapsible header when you don&rsquo;t have anything published in the top      area</li>
      <li>16 Widget areas &ndash; most are fully collapsible</li>
      <li>Bottom Widget areas offers a different style for each group</li>
      <li>Built-in Search &ndash; so you don&rsquo;t have to use the search widget</li>
      <li>Built-in Breadcrumbs &ndash; no plugin is needed</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>PHOTOSHOP Template Customization </h3>
  <p>If you decide you want to make custom modifications to this   template, you will need the actual files used to create this theme for   Joomla. Only select memberships gives access to these so if you are not   on any Photoshop membership, you can always upgrade to gain access. Keep   note that the Photoshop templates are not released under the GPL   license and may not be redistributed or resold in any way or form   without written permission from Pixel Theme Studio.</p>
  <h3>WordPress Themes</h3>
  <p>Prestige  will be tested for WordPress 3.0 because as you may be aware that WordPress 3 is coming and many are wondering if themes and templates from Pixel Theme Studio will work on this new version. My themes will be available for the WordPress 3 version and will be classified as WordPress 3 templates on the PTS website with an icon. If any previous templates need upgrading, a review will be done as to which ones will be on the list - or possibly re-designed! You can keep up to date with the PTS blog as well any Information FAQ's for <a href="http://www.pixelthemestudio.ca/dev/information/909-themes-a-templates-information">Themes and Templates</a>. </p>
  <h3>WordPress Tutorials for Prestige</h3>
  <p>To help you install and setup your Prestige theme, you can login to your members area at the Pixel Theme Studio website and view the tutorials to help learn how to use the various features and functions of this professional theme. But for the mean time, this document will help you learn how to get setup quickly with only the specifics because everything else is basic WordPress functionality like widgets, page creations, posts, etc.</p>
